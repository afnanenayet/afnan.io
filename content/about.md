My name is Afnan Enayet. I'm a software engineer currently in the Bay Area. I
studied Computer Science at Dartmouth College. I was on the Dartmouth Cycling
Team, I play guitar, and I love taking pictures. Check out my pictures
[on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/150451945@N05/)!

I enjoy learning CS theory, in particular graphics and rendering. My research
was on Monte Carlo sampling theory, and I hope to continue contributing to the
field.  Outside of graphics, I find compilers and type theory rather
interesting, and I like interesting programming languages like
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), and
[Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/).

## Contact

You can reach me at `afnan at afnan dot io`.

I use PGP keys to sign and encrypt my emails. My public key is probably
available on the usual public key servers. You can also access it
